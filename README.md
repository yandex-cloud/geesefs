GeeseFS is a high-performance, POSIX-ish S3
([Yandex](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/services/storage), [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/))
file system written in Go

# Overview

GeeseFS allows you to mount an S3 bucket as a file system.

FUSE file systems based on S3 typically have performance problems, especially with small files and metadata operations.

GeeseFS attempts to solve these problems by using aggressive parallelism and asynchrony.

**Y** Only works correctly with Yandex S3.

**\*** Directory renames are allowed in Goofys for directories with no more than 1000 entries and the limit is hardcoded.

List of non-POSIX behaviors/limitations for GeeseFS:
* File mode/owner/group, symbolic links, custom mtimes and special files (block/character devices,
  named pipes, UNIX sockets) are supported, but they are restored correctly only when
  using Yandex S3 because standard S3 doesn't return user metadata in listings and
  reading all this metadata in standard S3 would require an additional HEAD request
  for every file in listing which would make listings too slow.
* Special file support is enabled by default for Yandex S3 (disable with `--no-specials`) and disabled for others.
* File mode/owner/group are disabled by default even for Yandex S3 (enable with `--enable-perms`).
  When disabled, global permissions can be set with `--(dir|file)-mode` and `--(uid|gid)` options.
* Custom modification times are also disabled by default even for Yandex S3 (enable with `--enable-mtime`).
  When disabled:
  - `ctime`, `atime` and `mtime` are always the same
  - file modification time can't be set by user (for example with `cp --preserve`, `rsync -a` or utimes(2))
* Does not support hard links
* Does not support locking
* Does not support "invisible" deleted files. If an app keeps an opened file descriptor
  after deleting the file it will get ENOENT errors from FS operations

In addition to the items above:
* Default file size limit is 1.03 TB, achieved by splitting the file into 1000x 5MB parts,
  1000x 25 MB parts and 8000x 125 MB parts. You can change part sizes, but AWS's own limit
  is anyway 5 TB.

# Stability

GeeseFS is stable enough to pass most of `xfstests` which are applicable,
including dirstress/fsstress stress-tests (generic/007, generic/011, generic/013).

\* Recursive listing optimisation in Goofys is buggy and may skip files under certain conditions

\* S3FS uses server-side copy, but it still downloads the whole file to update it. And it's buggy too :-)

\* rclone mount has VFS cache, but it can only cache whole files. And it's also buggy - it often hangs on write.

\* xattrs without extra RTT only work with Yandex S3 (--list-type=ext-v1).

\* Partial object updates (PATCH) only work with Yandex S3.

## Partial object updates (PATCH)

With Yandex S3 it is possible to do partial object updates (data only) without server-side copy or reupload.

Currently the feature can be enabled with `--enable-patch` and will be enabled by default for YC S3 in the future.

Enabling patch uploads has the following benefits:
- Fast [fsync](#fsync): since nothing needs to be copied, fsync is now much cheaper
- Support for [concurrent updates](#concurrent-patch)
- Better memory utilization: less intermediate state needs to be cached, so more memory can be used for (meta)data cache
- Better performance for big files

Note: new files, metadata changes and renames are still flushed to S3 as multipart uploads.

# Installation

* Pre-built binaries:
  * [Linux amd64](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs/releases/latest/download/geesefs-linux-amd64).
    You may also need to install FUSE utils (fuse3 or fuse RPM/Debian package) first.
  * [Mac amd64](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs/releases/latest/download/geesefs-mac-amd64),
    [arm64](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs/releases/latest/download/geesefs-mac-arm64). You also need osxfuse/macfuse for GeeseFS to work.
  * [Windows x64](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs/releases/latest/download/geesefs-win-x64.exe).
    You also need to install [WinFSP](https://winfsp.dev) first.
* Or build from source with Go 1.13 or later:

```ShellSession
$ git clone https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs
$ cd geesefs
$ go build
```

# Usage

```ShellSession
$ cat ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKID1234567890
aws_secret_access_key = MY-SECRET-KEY
$ $GOPATH/bin/geesefs <bucket> <mountpoint>
$ $GOPATH/bin/geesefs [--endpoint https://...] <bucket:prefix> <mountpoint> # if you only want to mount objects under a prefix
```

You can also supply credentials via the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

To mount an S3 bucket on startup make sure the credential is
configured for `root` and add this to `/etc/fstab`:

```
bucket    /mnt/mountpoint    fuse.geesefs    _netdev,allow_other,--file-mode=0666,--dir-mode=0777    0    0
```

You can also use a different path to the credentials file by adding `,--shared-config=/path/to/credentials`.

See also: [Instruction for Azure Blob Storage](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs/blob/master/README-azure.md).

Systems with SELinux enabled automatically relabel mounted directories with the label 'fusefs_t.' To retain the original label, utilize the 'context' mount option:

```
bucket    /mnt/mountpoint    fuse.geesefs    context="system_u:object_r:<YOUR_LABEL>:s0",_netdev,allow_other,--file-mode=0666,--dir-mode=0777    0    0
```


## Windows

Everything is the same after installing [WinFSP](https://winfsp.dev) and GeeseFS, except that GeeseFS
can't daemonize so you have to create a system service manually if you want to hide the console window.

You can put credentials to `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.aws\credentials`, or you can put credentials in any
file and specify it with `--shared-config file.txt`, or you can use environment variables:

```
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

And then start GeeseFS with `geesefs <bucket> <mountpoint>`, where `<mountpoint>` is either a drive
(like K:) or a non-existing directory. Example:

```
geesefs-win-x64.exe testbucket K:
```

# Benchmarks

# Configuration

There's a lot of tuning you can do. Consult `geesefs -h` to view the list of options.

# Common Issues

## Memory Limit

**New since 0.37.0:** metadata cache memory usage is now also limited, OOM errors
caused by metadata should now go away.

GeeseFS uses RAM for two purposes:

1. **Metadata** (file listings). One metadata entry uses ~1 KB of data. Total
   number of cached entries is limited by `--entry-limit` and `--stat-cache-ttl`,
   because non-expired entries can't be removed from cache. Modified entries
   and entries with open file/directory descriptors are also never removed from
   cache. Cache TTL is 60 seconds by default, cached entry limit is 100000 by
   default, but in reality GeeseFS is able to list files faster, so the actual
   limit will be ~250000 when doing a plain listing of a very long bucket.

2. **Data**. Default data cache limit in GeeseFS is 1 GB (`--memory-limit`).
   GeeseFS uses cache for both read buffers when it needs to load data from the
   server and write buffers when user applications write data.

   At the same time, default "large" readahead setting is set to 100 MB which
   is optimal for linear read performance.

   However, that means that more than 10 processes trying to read large files
   at the same time may exceed the memory limit by requesting more than 1000 MB
   of buffers. Starting with v0.43.0, GeeseFS allows it, but you may turn this
   off by using mount option `--use-enomem`, which will make GeeseFS prevent
   exceeding memory limit and return ENOMEM errors to some of the processes instead.

   The other way to overcome this problem is to either raise `--memory-limit` (for
   example to 4 GB) or reduce `--read-ahead-large` (for example to 20 MB).

## Maximizing Throughput

If you have a lot of free network bandwidth and you want to achieve more MB/s of
linear write speed, make sure you're writing into multiple files (not just 1)
and start geesefs with the following options:

```
geesefs --no-checksum --memory-limit 4000 \
    --max-flushers 32 --max-parallel-parts 32 --part-sizes 25
```

This increases parallelism at cost of reducing maximum file size to 250 GB
(10000 parts * 25 MB) and increasing memory usage. With a lot of available
network bandwidth you'll be able to reach ~1.6 GB/s write speed. For example,
with fio:

```
fio -name=test -ioengine=libaio -direct=1 -bs=4M -iodepth=1 -fallocate=none \
    -numjobs=8 -group_reporting -rw=write -size=10G
```

## Concurrent Updates

GeeseFS doesn't support concurrent updates of the same file from multiple hosts. If you try to
do that you should guarantee that one host calls `fsync()` on the modified file and then waits
for at least `--stat-cache-ttl` (1 minute by default) before allowing other hosts to start
updating the file. Other way is to refresh file/directory cache forcibly using `setfattr -n .invalidate <filename>`.
This forces GeeseFS to recheck file/directory state from the server. If you don't do that
you may encounter lost updates (conflicts) which are reported in the log in the following way:

```
main.WARNING File xxx/yyy is deleted or resized remotely, discarding local changes
```

### Concurrent PATCH

When using Yandex S3, it is possible to concurrently update a single object/file from multiple hosts
using PATCH method (`--enable-patch`). However, concurrent changes are not reported back to the clients,
so you have to stop all writes and refresh the inode cache to see the changes made by other hosts.

It is strongly advised to write data in non-overlapping ranges to avoid conflicts.
If you do overlapping writes then you have to guarantee that your hosts coordinate
and serialize their updates by doing an `fsync()` before the next overlapping write.

Also note that even with PATCH, best performance is achieved when writes are aligned
with object part boundaries (i.e. with 5 MB chunks for the first 5 GB by default),
because the server may do internal read-modify-write for patched object parts, and
it also may return an error if too many parallel requests try to modify the same
object part. Such "PATCH failures" are reported in the log in the following way:

```
main.WARNING Failed to patch range %d-%d of file %s (inode %d) due to concurrent updates
```

Normally, GeeseFS retries requests failed in this way, but if you don't want it
to retry them, you can also choose to drop the cached update by enabling
`--drop-patch-conflicts`.

## Asynchronous Write Errors

GeeseFS buffers updates in memory (or disk cache, if enabled) and flushes them asynchronously,
so writers don't get an error from an unsuccessful write. When an error occurs, GeeseFS keeps
modifications in the cache and retries to flush them to the server later. GeeseFS tries to
flush the data forever until success or until you stop GeeseFS mount process. If there is
too much changed data and memory limit is reached during write, write request hangs until
some data is flushed to the server to make it possible to free some memory.

### fsync

If you want to make sure that your changes are actually persisted to the server you have to
call [fsync](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html) on a file or directory.
Calling `fsync` on a directory makes GeeseFS flush all changes inside it. It's stricter than
Linux and POSIX behaviour where fsync-ing a directory only flushes directory entries
(i.e., renamed files) in it.

If a server or network error occurs during `fsync`, the caller receives an error code.

Example of calling `fsync`. Note that both directories and files should be opened as files:

```
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys, os
os.fsync(os.open(sys.argv[1], os.O_RDONLY))
```

Command-line `sync` utility and [syncfs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syncfs.2.html) syscall
don't work with GeeseFS because they aren't wired up in FUSE at all.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience any problems with GeeseFS - if it crashes, hangs or does something else nasty:

- Update to the latest version if you haven't already done it
- Check your system log (syslog/journalctl) and dmesg for error messages from GeeseFS
- Try to start GeeseFS in debug mode: `--debug_s3 --debug_fuse --log-file /path/to/log.txt`,
  reproduce the problem and send it to us via Issues or any other means.
- If you experience crashes, you can also collect a core dump and send it to us:
  - Run `ulimit -c unlimited`
  - Set desired core dump path with `sudo sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=/tmp/core-%e.%p.%h.%t`
  - Start geesefs with `GOTRACEBACK=crash` environment variable

## Compatibility with S3

geesefs works with:
* Yandex Object Storage (default)
* Amazon S3
* Ceph (and also Ceph-based Digital Ocean Spaces, DreamObjects, gridscale etc)
* Minio
* OpenStack Swift
* Azure Blob Storage (even though it's not S3)
* Backblaze B2
* Selectel S3

It should also work with any other S3 that implements multipart uploads and
multipart server-side copy (UploadPartCopy).

Services known to be **broken**:
* CloudFlare R2. They have an issue with throttling - instead of using HTTP 429 status
  code they return 403 Forbidden if you exceed 5 requests per seconds.

Important note: you should mount geesefs with `--list-type 2` or `--list-type 1` options
if you use it with non-Yandex S3.

The following backends are inherited from Goofys code and still exist, but are broken:
* Google Cloud Storage
* Azure Data Lake Gen1
* Azure Data Lake Gen2
